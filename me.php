        Hi 👋👋👋. I am Dhirodatto Biswas hailing from Berhampore, Murshidabad, West Bengal, India. I am a student of class 8 (as of January 2022) and am an aspiring web developer. I also develop certain OpenGL programs and solve <a href="https://codeforces.com/problemset?order=BY_RATING_ASC">Codeforces problems</a> in Java.<br><br>
        I was insipired by computers and their functioning when I was introduced to computers back in 2015. Neither did I know the thing very well, nor I had any knowledge of programming. Anyways, in 2018, when I was in grade 5, BASIC was introduced to me in our school. It was a turning point in my life. I began to learn the language thoroughly. Till date, I dont know the graphic functions of BASIC though 😜. But my actual programming started when the Coronavirus outbreak began. I had nothing to do, so, I started to code. And could not refarin from doing it. I remember my first work with PHP was a login form back in 2020. I was a noob back then ( and I am still a noob 🤦‍♀️). I learnt PHP and fell in love with it.<br>
        The past year I also learnt some sytem-end languages like Java, C++, Go and etc due to the advise of <a href="https://thearitroshomeblog.blogspot.com" title="Go visit his blog!!">b4apple</a> and truly, I think it was important. building OpenGL images using C++ is the most fun. While solving problems in Java is also interesting. <br><br>
        Also, I must add that I ❤ FOSS.

    Alright! This blog is a medium for me to put forward my programming and other ideas to the whole world.
